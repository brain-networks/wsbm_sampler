detect communities using weighted stochastic blockmodel

MATLAB code that calls a functions for fitting a [weighted stochastic blockmodel](http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/wsbm/) to network data. As an example, we show an application to a functional connectivity matrix.

Unlike Infomap and modularity maximization, which are the two most common community detection methods used in network neuroscience, the WSBM is capable of detecting more general classes of communities, rather than the traditional internally dense and externally sparse assortative organization.
